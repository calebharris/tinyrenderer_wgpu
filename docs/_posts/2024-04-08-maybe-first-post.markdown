This might actually end up being the first post to this blog. Still nothing
super interesting about wgpu or rendering yet, but I finally have the static
site solution (Jekyll) and them (Hacker) set up in a way I can live with.

Although, I do have the first pass at a basic app that renders a 2d texture and
works on both native and web, so more to come soon!
